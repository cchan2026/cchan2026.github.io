                <h2>A Welcome Letter from a Fellow Warrior</h2>
                &nbsp;
                <p>Dear Warriors, welcome to the Mobile Legends Role-Picking Guide! This is a site that will guide you in the role-picking in the game Mobile Legends: Bang Bang. We sincerely hope that you will learn which role to pick during the drafting phase of the game after your visit in this site.</p>
                <p>As an introduction,</p>
                <p><i>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, commonly referred to as ML or MLBB, is a mobile multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed and published by Moonton, a subsidiary of ByteDance. Released in 2016, the game grew in popularity worldwide, most prominently in Southeast Asia, and has since crossed the 1 billion downloads feat, with peak monthly players of 100 million.</i></p>
                <p><i>At its core, the game pits 2 teams of 5 against each other in real time with at least 10-second matchmaking and 10-minute matches. Featuring traditional battle arena gameplay, players must fight over three lanes to take the enemy's tower and defend their own. Like classic MOBAs, there is no hero training to level up or pay to play angleâ€”winners and losers are decided based on skill, ability, and strategy.</i></p>
                <p><i>Following success, Moonton has tapped into the esports scene with the creation of several regional tournaments dubbed as Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Professional League (MPL) in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Middle East and North Africa regions that serves as a qualifier for the Mobile Legends World Championships where a total of 15 countries, including Japan, Russia, and the United States, have participated so far. It was also among the 6 games chosen for the first medal event of esports competition at the 2019 Southeast Asian Games held in the Philippines.</i></p>
                <p>This guide will mainly focus on guiding my fellow warriors in the role-picking stage of the drafting phase before the start of each match in the game. It is highly important for players to know which role to pick depending on the enemy team composition, allied team composition, and the type of playstyle that they have. Players also need to know the heroes that can counter the enemy picks and complement the heroes on their team's side.</p>
                <p>As a background, many players, including me, get really annoyed because of how other players in our team ruin our draft for the match with their undeniably stupid hero picks. Consequently, this is most of the time the reason why I lose in the Ranked matches that I play. Though we try to adjust to the allied players' troll picks, it is not enough since composition balance and everyone's playstyles need to be taken consideration of in the draft-picking.</p>
                <p>Thus, using this site, we are hoping that players would learn what heroes to righfully pick in the drafting phase.</p>
                <p>That would be all, thank you very much and welcome again, Warriors!</p>
                &nbsp;
                <p>Sincerely,</p>
                <p>A Fellow Warrior</p>
